## Tech Stack

-   Node.js
-   Express
-   MongoDB
-   Jest

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Run the server

```
npm run dev
```

### Run your lint and tests

```
npm run test
```

### Local Database Setup

These are the Mac instructions for setting up the database in your local. The Windows instructions for installing Mongo are to be added later but a quick Google search should do the trick.

1. Install brew if you don't have it already (this takes a while)

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. Install and Run MongoDb

```
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.2
brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
```

3. Download the database GUI of your choice to view the data in a more user-friendly way. I recommend Robo 3T.
   https://robomongo.org/download

- Click 'Create' to create a new connection (use the defaults).
- Click Save
- Click Connect

On the first run, there won't be anything in the database. Once you start adding things in the application, those collections will show up.

## Known Issues

* Restarting the server makes a user's hand disappear until they refresh their browser.
* The styles are not responsive.
* Because the app is on Heroku and I'm not paying for the live server, the UI and API take serveral seconds to boot up.
